# Euro FX Commitment of Traders Analysis

## Commitment of Traders (COT)

The Commitment of traders is a weekly report issued by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)](http://www.cftc.gov) containing the holdings of participants 
in various futures markets in the United States. The data collected by the CFTC covers positions in futures on financial instruments, metals, petroleum, currencies and other commodities.
The COT reports provide a breakdown of each Tuesday's open interest for markets in which 20 or more traders hold positions equal to or above the reporting levels established by the CFTC.
For example, some reports show data for commercial and non commercial holdings, spreading, changes from previous report, percents of open interest by category, and number of traders.
